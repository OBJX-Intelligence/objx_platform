## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r config/requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   cd backend
   python app_fixed.py
   ```

4. Access the platform:
   - Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
   - Login with test credentials (test@example.com / password123)

## Foundation Documents

The system is built on six foundation documents that establish the Trinity Architecture:

1. 00_living_doctrine_the_why.md
2. 01_foundation_principles_universal.md
3. 02_trinity_architecture_universal.md
4. 03_intelligence_memory_compound.md
5. 04_partnership_protocols_complete.md
6. 06_evolution_continuous_improvement.md

These documents should be placed in the `backend/foundation_docs/` directory for proper system initialization.

## API Endpoints

The platform includes several API endpoints:

- `/api/agents/status` - Get status of all agents
- `/api/documents/templates` - Get available document templates
- `/api/analysis/run` - Run analysis with specified parameters
- `/api/workflow/optimize` - Optimize workflow with agent orchestration

## Notes for Developers

- The system uses device pixel ratio compensation to ensure proper display across all environments
- All styling is inline for simplicity and portability
- The backend uses Flask with OpenAI and mem0 integrations
- Foundation documents are loaded at startup for the Trinity Architecture
